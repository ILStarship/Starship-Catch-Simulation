[HEADER2]How do I Control Starship?
[HEADER3]   Before Landing Flip:
[BODY]1. The left and right arrows moves the ship left and right respectively.
[BODY]2. The up and down arrow makes the ship descend slower and faster respectively.
[BODY]   (There is a limit on how fast and slow depending on the difficulty level)
[BODY]3. Pressing the space key makes ship perform landing flip.
[HEADER3]   After Landing Flip:
[BODY]1. The left and right arrows moves the ship left and right respectively.
[BODY]   (Pressing the right shift key increases the speed of moving left or right)
[BODY]2. Pressing the space key fires engine at a rate that results in no change of speed.
[BODY]3. Pressing the space and the left shift key fires engine at a rate that results in deceleration.

[HEADER2]Keys
[BODY]  1. After flight terminates, press the key [Q] to return to level screen.
